    Section without id: Setting up environment variables
    MachineLabs' needs two environment variables in your shell - MACHINELABS_FB_CLIENT_EMAIL and MACHINELABS_FB_PRIVATE_KEY. Those need to be exported in your environment. The values for those two environment variables can be found in firebase under Project Overview -> Settings -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts -> Firebase Admin SDK

    You need to Generate a private key from there. Notice that the generated key is a huge string with line breaks, represented as \n. You need to replace those with actual line breaks when adding the key to your environment.

    The service account email address will be shown on the same page.

    Running the app
    Now that everything's set up, we can run our app locally.

    Running the server
    To run the server, navigate to the server folder and execute the following command:

    $ cd server
    $ npx yarn build --env=YOUR_ENV_NAME && node dist/index.js
    This will build the server using your personal environment file and serve the resulting distribution file. You might notice that it'll also build all packages in shared. If you don't want it to build the shared libraries, use the --skip-shared option as follows:
